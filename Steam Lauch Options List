Source Dedicated Server

Command-line arguments for the Source Dedicated Server executable (<code>srcds.exe, srcds_run)
Command-line parameters

-allowdebug
    (Same as -debug ?) 
-autoupdate
    The server is searching for updates on startup (Linux/Unix only). 
-console
    SrcDS will run in console mode (Windows only). 
-debug
    Debug Mode. 
-dev
    Show developer messages. 
-game <game or path>
    Specifies which game/mod to run. Accepts either a path to a gameinfo.txt, or one of these pre-set values. 
-insecure
    Will start the server without Valve Anti-Cheat. 
-ip
    Specifies the address to use for the bind(2) syscall, which controls on which IP addresses the program is reachable on. It must either be a local address (an addresses of the host it runs on) or 0.0.0.0 (the wildcard). This has nothing to do with externally-visible addresses in NAT setups. 
-maxplayers <number>
    Specifies how many player slots the server can contain. 
-nobots
    Disable bots. 
-nohltv
    Disables SourceTV and closes its port (usually 27020). 
-norestart
    Won't attempt to restart failed servers. 
-port
    The port the server advertises to clients. 
-steam
    Use this (along with -console) when you are running the version of SRCDS downloaded through Steam. 
-tickrate <number>
    Specifies Server-Tickrate (for more info see Source Multiplayer Networking). This doesn't exist on TF2, CSS, L4D, and L4D2. 
-timeout <number>
    Sleep for <number> seconds before restarting a failed server. 
-dumplongticks
    Generate minidumps when there are long server frames 
-usercon
    Enables RCON for CS:GO Servers 

Console variables

    +<console variable> <arg> - Sets the Cvar (or console variable) to the specified setting.

Some useful console variables

    +hostname "Hostname" - Specifies the name of the server (Spaces between words won't work here!).
    +ip - Specifies the IP when multiple network cards are installed (Old, but still works).
    +map <map> - Specifies which map to start.
    +maxplayers <number> - Specifies how many player slots the server can contain (Old, but still works).
    +hostport <port> - Specifies the host port (Port specification before -port was added, but can still be used).
    +clientport <port> - Specifies the client port (The port the server advertises to clients, the same as -port and clientport in console)
    +sv_lan <0/1> - If set to 1, server is only available in Local Area Network (LAN).

Linux command options in Left 4 Dead (2)

The linux version of Left 4 Dead and Left 4 Dead 2 dedicated server added extra server commands.

As part of the forking functionality mentioned below, the server parameters support substitution. For instance, if you specify +exec autoexec##.cfg, then the first server will execute autoexec01.cfg, the second autoexec02.cfg, and so on.

    -netconport <number> - Creates a remotely accessible server console on the specified port. This can be connected to with telnet or similar applications, and allows controlling of the server as if the commands were being typed in at the console
    -netconpassword "password" - It set, users must type PASS "password" to use the remote console described above
    -fork <number> - Starts up the specified number of servers at once. They will each use the first available port number at 27015 or above.

Half-Life Dedicated Server

These command-line parameters are used with hlds.exe for Goldsource (Half-Life) games.
Command parameters are described inside the < and > characters.

Syntax: hlds.exe <parameter1> <parameter2> <cvar1> <cvar2>
Examples

    hlds.exe -console -game cstrike +sv_lan 0 +maxplayers 22 +map de_dust2
    ./hlds_run -game cstrike -autoupdate -pingboost 2 -port 27016 +maxplayers 20 +map de_dust2

Command-line parameters

    -condebug - Stores console output to "Half-Life\qconsole.log".
    Can be toggled with condebug console command.
    -dev - Enables developer mode.
    -autoupdate - The server is searching for updates on startup (no longer works?[confirm]).
    -console - HLDS will run in console mode (Windows only).
    -game <game> - Specifies which game/mod to run. Default is "valve".
    -dll <name.dll> - Specifies which DLL to use. Ex: -dll addons\metamod\dlls\metamod.dll.
    -nomaster - Disable communication with Master server. Use this parameter if you do not want your server to be listed in Server Browser.
    Also disables server queries.
    -insecure - Disables Valve Anti-Cheat technology.
    -port <port> - Specifies which port to use for client connections. Default is 27015.
    Can do the same with port console variable.
    -sport <port> - Specifies the VAC port the server should use. Default is 26900.
    You only need to change -sport if VAC connections fail through the primary port.
    -noip - Disables network support.
    -noipx - Disables IPX support.
    -tos - Enables the LOWDELAY TOS header in the udp/ip packets the server generates. (Linux only)
    -nobreakpad - Let plugin authors still get old style minidumps if they need it (win32 only)
    -num_edicts <variable> - Sets the entity limit for map/game entities (not temporary entities, which is still locked to 500). 900 is default. 4096 is a good limit, beyond that seems to cause hunk_alloc errors[confirm]. Both clients and servers need matching values for best compatibility[confirm].
    -heapsize <kilobytes> - Specifies the amount of heap(or free store - cache, an area of memory used for dynamic memory allocation) the engine will use. Minimum value is 14336(14 MB). Maximum value is 131072(128 MB). By default this is set to 40960 (40 MB) and automatically adjusted to suit your system.
    Low value causes "Unable to allocate X.X MB" exit error.
    -zone <bytes> - Specifies the amount of Bytes of memory for use with the console system.
    Low value causes Z_Malloc exit error.
    -maxplayers <number> - Sets the maximum number of players that will be able to join your server.
    Can do the same with maxplayers console variable.
    -sys_ticrate - Overrides sys_ticrate cvar.
    -exec <file> - Execute specific config file immediately after the engine is loaded.
    +<console variable> <arg> - Sets the Cvar (or console variable) to the specified setting.

Useful console variables

    +hostname "Server Name" - Specifies the name of the server.
    +ip <address> - Specifies the IP when multiple network cards are installed. Required for VAC2 operation.
    Usually you do not need to specify this.
    +map <map> - Specifies which map to start with.
    +sv_lan <0/1> - If set to 1, server is only available in Local Area Network (LAN).
    +mapchangecfgfile <file> - Like Server.cfg, ran after every round change, before Plugins are started.
    -pingboost <1/2/3> - Selects between optimized HLDS network code stack. Set this on 2 usually reduces latency toward 1ms without loss of activity input packets.
